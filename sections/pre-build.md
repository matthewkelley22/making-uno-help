# Structure

Arduino's kit doesn't come with soldering equipment, so this file is primarily intended for people who do not have soldering equipment, or may be interested in how they can expand their soldering gear. There will be different sections based on how much you're willing to spend/what level of equipment you're thinkging to buy.

DISCLAIMER: None of this is financial advice and I'm not a financial advisor, I'm just a random dude jotting down some ideas on what I think is helpful.

# Gear Recommendations

## Absolute Minimum

The equipment from this section is the absolute minimum you'll need to solder anything.

| Item | Description  |
|----|----|
|$15 Plusive soldering kit on Amazon | The basic necessities to get you started. |
| Lead-free solder | You're going to need more solder than you get in the kit, and you'll get lead poisoning if you use leaded solder and don't follow proper procedure. Look for a RoHS symbol on the solder and you should be good. |
| Lead-free solder wick | You fix your mistakes with solder wick and you'll be making a lot, so you're going to need plenty of wick. A solder sucker is like a sledgehammer, but you need something smaller.(Same as the solder, look for RoHS-compliant or something along those lines) |
| NEIKO 01902 PCB Holder | Your hands will be full when soldering, so you need something to hold whatever you're soldering that won't burn. |
| Eye Protection | If something gets in your eye at the temperatures you'll be working at, you're going to lose it. Don't solder without eye protection. |

## Barebones

Either upgrades or additions to the items in the soldering kit. You don't need to get everything in this section or any section below this, just get what you think will be the most use to you.

- Pinecil Soldering Iron or SainSmart TS101 Soldering Iron (and Soldering Iron Holder if missing one)

You can power these soldering irons with a USB-C laptop charger, so you get to use them farther from the wall and switch soldering tips while still hot. They should also heat up faster than the soldering iron from the kit.

- Soldering Mat

You've got a lot of options (mostly silicone), but I'd suggest going for something with ESD protection. You don't want to fry what you're soldering and waste all your time and money. This also protects whatever surface you're working on.

- Kaisiking Wire Soldering Tip Cleaner

Wire soldering tip cleaner - no more wetting a sponge before soldering. It's $9 and comes with wire replacements.

## Hobbyist

This is the stuff hobbyists or people with money burning a hole in their pocket should be looking at.

### Less Expensive

This section's equipment is mostly upgrades to the Absolute Minimum  and Barebones sections.


### More Expensive

## Professional

If you're looking recommendations on professional-level gear you've come to the wrong place.
