# Structure

Arduino's kit doesn't come with soldering equipment, so this file is primarily intended for people who do not have soldering equipment, or may be interested in how they can expand their soldering gear. There will be different sections based on how much you're willing to spend/what level of equipment you're thinkging to buy.

DISCLAIMER: None of this is financial advice and I'm not a financial advisor, I'm just a random dude jotting down some ideas on what I think is helpful.
